                        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android
                         and iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles.
                         With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
                         as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
                         bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next
                         section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                        <p>React Native runs on <span class="ung">React</span>, a popular open source library for building user
                         interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
                         React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>

                        <p><span class="b9">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                         friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>

                        <p> <span class="b9">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
                         inside JavaScript like so: <span class="bgg">&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;</span>. The React docs
                         have <span class="ung">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX
                         is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name
                         <span class="bgg">&#60;Text&#62;</span>.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p> <span class="b9">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                         how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage.
                         State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from
                         user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                         onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed,
                         and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

                        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                         language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                         "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
